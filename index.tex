\markright{Learning Objectives}

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Describe the differences between z tests and t tests, including when
  to use each based on knowledge of population parameters and sample
  characteristics.
\item
  Calculate and interpret the test statistic, p value, and effect size
  for one-sample t tests and goodness-of-fit analyses.
\item
  Clearly explain the distinction between statistical significance and
  practical significance, and evaluate both to provide a comprehensive
  understanding of research findings.
\item
  Use confidence intervals to quantify uncertainty in sample mean
  estimates and evaluate the plausibility of a null hypothesis.
\end{itemize}

We just learned about z tests in the previous chapter, which you can
conduct if you want to compare a sample mean to a population with a
known mean and standard deviation. Often, however, we do not know the
population standard deviation (σ), and we must estimate it with the
sample statistic, in this case sample standard deviation (s). When this
happens, we can no longer rely on the standard normal distribution, also
called the z distribution, as it assumes precise knowledge of σ.
Instead, we use a t distribution, which accounts for the added
uncertainty of estimating σ. In these cases, we use a t distribution,
which closely resembles its z-distribution counterpart but with two key
differences.

First, the tail ends of the t distribution take longer to approach the
X-axis compared to the z distribution. This is because we are estimating
the population standard deviation, and that means we have more
uncertainty. If you look at figure 8.1, imagine drawing a vertical line
out towards one of the ends. Can you see how there would be more area
under the curve for the t distribution with just 5 degrees of freedom?
Shaded areas under the curve represent 5\% of the total area. This means
the sample mean must be farther from the population mean before we can
confidently conclude that the observed difference reflects something
other than random chance.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapter8_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-1-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{Fig 8.1: Comparison of Standard Normal and t-Distributions}

\end{figure}%

Second, there is more than one t distribution, and the shape of the
distribution depends on your sample size. Recall that a larger sample
size leads to a smaller standard error, which in turn increases your
statistical power to detect a significant effect. You can see how
different t distributions look in figure 8.1. The larger the sample
size, the closer the t distribution becomes to a z distribution. Once n
\textgreater{} 120, the two distributions are almost identical. Having
such a large sample makes up for the fact that we are estimating the
population standard deviation.

Another way to look at this is that the t distribution is related to the
degrees of freedom. You must know the degrees of freedom to utilize a t
table. Since sample standard deviation is used to compute the estimate
of standard error, the degrees of freedom for a t test are calculated by
using n - 1.

\section{Example: Conducting one sample
t-test}\label{example-conducting-one-sample-t-test}

Now, let's walk through an example of conducting a one-sample t test.
Let's think back to the example from the last chapter, where we compared
a sample mean to a population mean with the z test. We have a similar,
but slightly different, scenario this time. We have a sample of just 35
test scores from a single third grade class. The teacher is concerned
that their students are underperforming in English Language Arts (ELA)
and hypothesize their class will score below the state average of 440.
When the results were returned to the school, the class's average score
was 425.26. Is this average significantly lower than the expected value
of 440? Let's conduct a hypothesis test to find out.

\subsection{Step 1: Determine the null and alternative
hypotheses.}\label{step-1-determine-the-null-and-alternative-hypotheses.}

Just like last time, the null hypothesis is that there is no difference
between the teacher's class and the overall state population. So, the
null hypothesis is:

\[
H_0: \mu = 440
\]

This time, however, we are going to use a directional, or one-tailed
test, because the teacher is specifically concerned that the students
are scoring lower than the general population. So, the alternative
hypothesis is:

\[
H_1: \mu < 440
\]

There are 35 students in this class, which might be why they are not
doing so well, so n = 35. The sampling distribution in this case would
be composed of the means of all possible samples of size n = 35 taken
from the state population of third graders. It would be centered at μ =
440 (the population mean, which we know), but we must calculate the
standard error using the sample standard deviation. The sample standard
deviation (s) happens to be 44.994.

\[
\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{44.994}{\sqrt{35}} = 7.605
\]

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapter8_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{Fig 8.2: Comparison of Sampling Distribution (t, df=34) and
Normal Distribution}

\end{figure}%

\subsection{Step 2: Set the criteria for a
decision.}\label{step-2-set-the-criteria-for-a-decision.}

We will set the alpha level (α) to 0.05. So, we will reject the null
hypothesis if the p value is less than 0.05. Since we are conducting a
one-sided directional test, the entire rejection region is in the left
tail of the distribution. To find the critical value we first need to
consider our degrees of freedom. For a t test, df = n -- 1, so we have
34 degrees of freedom. In the Critical Values of t distribution table in
the appendix, there is no line for df = 34, so round down to the nearest
degrees of freedom (30) as a conservative estimate. If you use an online
calculator, which allows you to enter precise degrees of freedom, you
will find that the critical value for 34 degrees of freedom at a .05
alpha level is -1.69. It is negative because we expect the sample mean
to be lower than the population mean.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapter8_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-3-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean (n=35)}

\end{figure}%

\subsection{Step 3: Check assumptions and compute the test
statistic.}\label{step-3-check-assumptions-and-compute-the-test-statistic.}

There are three assumptions underlying this test. They are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Random sampling: The scores come from a random, representative sample.
\item
  Independence: The scores are independent of one another.
\item
  Normality: The population score distribution is approximately normal.
\end{enumerate}

It is okay that we didn't choose a random sample representing all third
graders in the state because the inferences we will draw are only about
this one class. We can't see the entire population distribution, but the
histogram for the scores looks almost perfectly normal.

(fig 4 here)

If the distribution was way off, we could still proceed but be very
cautious about our interpretation of the results. Since our sample size
is greater than 30, we would be okay even without such a normal
distribution due to the central limit theorem. So, we are all set to
calculate our test statistic.

For the one-sample t test, we use the formula:

\[
t = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}
\]

Notice that the formula is very similar to what we used to calculate the
z statistic. The only difference is that we now estimate the standard
error using the sample standard deviation and sample size in the
denominator because we don't know the value of the population standard
deviation (𝜎).

The numerator represents the difference between the observed and test
value specified in the null hypothesis. The symbol 𝜇 represents the
population parameter specified in the hypothesis, often referred to as
the null value, as it reflects the assumed true population mean under
the null hypothesis. The other values for the test statistic come from
our sample data.

\[
t
= \frac{425.26 - 440}{\dfrac{44.994}{\sqrt{35}}}
= \frac{-14.74}{7.605}
= -1.938
\]

\subsection{Step 4}\label{step-4}

\subsubsection*{a: Find the p value.}\label{a-find-the-p-value.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{a: Find the p value.}

We must now determine whether our t statistic is significant, which
would mean that it is very unlikely we obtained this value due to chance
alone. In step 2, we said that the critical value for this test was
-1.69. Picture a t distribution and draw a vertical line about 1.7
standard deviations below the mean. Anything to the left of that is in
the rejection region. Is our t statistic of -1.938 in the rejection
region? Yes -- it is farther away from the center than our critical
value. This means our p value is less than 0.05.

(fig 8.5 here)

\subsubsection*{b: Draw a conclusion and report your
conclusion.}\label{b-draw-a-conclusion-and-report-your-conclusion.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{b: Draw a conclusion and report
your conclusion.}

Given that our p value is less than 0.05, the appropriate decision is to
reject the null hypothesis. In other words, we have found evidence in
favor of the alternative hypothesis. Students in this class scored
significantly lower than the overall state population on the test. Let's
assume we use statistical software to land on a p value of 0.03 for this
analysis.

\#\# Reporting Results in APA Format

The American Psychological Association, 7th edition (APA, 2019) has
decided that there is a correct way to report the results of a t test.
In this case, you would report the results of our test like this: Scores
for students in this third-grade class (M = 425.26) were significantly
lower than scores of third graders statewide, t(34) = -1.938, p = 0.03.

The most important part of the reporting is the section that starts with
the observed t statistic. You put the degrees of freedom in parentheses
immediately following the t; all statistics (e.g., M, t, p) are in
italics, and you report the p value after the exact t statistic.
Remember, that even if the statistical software says p = 0.000, you
should never report that. Instead, you should report p \textless{}
0.001. You can also just report that p \textless{} 0.05 (your alpha
level) if you do not have access to statistical software.

\section{Cautions with One-Sided
Tests}\label{cautions-with-one-sided-tests}

One caution with directional, one-tailed tests is that you need to
decide on one-tailed versus two-tailed tests up front. It is really not
okay to decide after you see the results that you are going to conduct a
one-tailed test. You should only be conducting a one-tailed test if you
have good reason to expect the sample mean to be lower or higher than,
rather than just different from, the population mean. And while a
one-tailed test has greater power to detect a significant result, there
is risk involved. Imagine that we expected the sample mean to be
significantly lower, but it turned out to be significantly higher than
the population mean. If we had been conducting a two-tailed test, that
would be a significant difference from the population mean. But since
our alternative hypothesis was that μ \textless{} 440, we would fail to
reject the null (non-significant result). Most of the time you will be
using a two-tailed test for the possibility of a difference in either
direction. Only use a one-tailed test if you have a very good reason and
you decide ahead of time to do so.

Another caution is that type III error is introduced when using
directional tests. Type III error occurs when a correct conclusion is
drawn for the wrong reason or when the wrong question is asked, and a
statistically valid result is obtained for that incorrect question. For
example, a school district wants to determine whether lessons learned
from a new professional development program will reduce the time
teachers spend on grading. After collecting data and running a
statistical test, the null hypothesis (that the program has no effect on
grading time) is rejected, and a significant difference was found.
District leadership interpreted this result as evidence that the program
was reducing grading time, so they decided to expand the program.
However, a few weeks later, teachers were demanding that the district
take a closer look at the data because they claimed to be spending more
time grading. Sure enough, district leadership found they made a
mistake: while the statistical test correctly identified a significant
difference in grading time (rejecting the null hypothesis), they
misinterpreted the direction of the effect. The program increased
grading time instead of reducing it. This misinterpretation of the
direction of the significant effect is a Type III error: correctly
rejecting the null hypothesis but misunderstanding what the result
actually implies.

\section{Understanding Effect Size}\label{understanding-effect-size}

Hypothesis testing is important for knowing if there is a significant
difference between a sample and the population, but it will not tell you
how big the difference is. A hypothesis test will almost always return a
significant result when you have a large sample size because a test
statistic is a function of standard error, which decreases as sample
size increases.

Given the mean difference and standard deviation remain the same, as
sample size increases, the test statistic always increases. For example,
if you wanted to conduct a one-sample t test with a sample mean of 22
and a SD of 2 compared to a population mean of 23.5, you are sure to get
a statistically significant result when n = 100,000 even if the p value
is \textgreater{} 0.05 when n = 10. It is somewhat paradoxical that with
sufficiently large sample size, the statistical power becomes strong
enough to flag even small differences as significant, even if those
differences are practically trivial or meaningless. Therefore, it is
important to have another way to represent the meaningfulness, or
practical significance, of a statistically significant result. That is
why we calculate and report effect size.

Of course, one way of understanding the size of the difference is to
simply compare the sample mean and population mean on the original
measurement scale. Someone who understands a particular testing
instrument could make their own judgment as to whether a difference of
about 15 points was meaningful, or cause for concern. But it helps to
have a common language for reporting effect size, and the way we do that
is to standardize the effect.

Effect size is a numeric measure that indicates the strength or
meaningfulness of the relationship or difference between variables in a
study. Unlike p values, which only tell you whether an effect exists,
effect size tells you how large or meaningful that effect is. It
provides a standardized way to understand the practical significance of
research findings, which is particularly useful when comparing results
across studies.

Estimated Cohen's d is a common measure of effect size for t tests. We
hope you remember back in chapter 5 when we learned about z scores,
which are also known as standardized scores because they are measured in
standard deviation units. When we use estimated Cohen's d as a measure
of effect size, we are doing the same thing. Cohen's d quantifies the
magnitude of the difference between two means relative to the
variability in the data and provides a standardized measure of practical
significance, helping to interpret the importance of the result by
allowing us to express the effect size in terms of standard deviation
units. This approach provides a common scale, making it easier to
compare results across different tests or measures, rather than relying
on raw score differences.

\section{Calculating Estimated Cohen's
d}\label{calculating-estimated-cohens-d}

One quick note to get us started -- we are being careful to refer to the
effect size we use for t tests as estimated Cohen's d to distinguish it
from Cohen's d used in z tests. This distinction arises because effect
sizes for t tests are calculated using sample data, whereas z tests rely
on known population parameters. But out in the world of educational
research, you will normally just hear it called Cohen's d regardless of
the type of analysis used.

Here is the formula for estimated Cohen's d for a one-sample t test:

\[
d = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{SD}
\]

In our example above, the sample mean (X̅) = 425.26 and SD = 44.994. The
population mean (μ) = 440. Using the formula,

\[
d
= \frac{425.26 - 440}{44.994}
= -0.33
\]

That is, our effect size is -0.33, which according to the following
table from Privitera (2018) is a medium effect size. In our sample
research question, this means the students in the third-grade class had
scores that were about one-third of a standard deviation below the state
average. A positive effect size indicates the sample mean was larger
than the population mean, and a negative effect size indicates it was
smaller. Since effect size can be negative, you need to consider the
absolute value when making a judgement about the strength of the effect.

Before we move on, we want to remind you of a few other similar formulas
because we had a tendency to get them confused in the past. First, here
is a reminder of the formula for calculating z scores:

\[
z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
\]

Do you see the differences between that and the formula used to
calculate Cohen's d? First, with a z score, we only have one X (i.e., a
particular value), rather than a sample mean, or X̅. But even more
importantly, we use the population standard deviation (σ) rather than
the sample SD to calculate a z score. But overall, the concept is
exactly the same: both z scores and Cohen's d involve converting a raw
difference from the mean into standard deviation units. The key
difference lies in the specific inputs used for calculations.

Do you see the differences between that and the formula used to

exactly the same: both z scores and Cohen's d involve converting a raw
difference from the mean into standard deviation units. The key
difference lies in the specific inputs used for calculations.

Another place we have seen learners, including ourselves, get tripped up
is confusing the formula for Cohen's d with the formula for the t
statistic itself. Here they are, side by side:

\[
\begin{aligned}
d = \frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{SD}, \quad
t = \frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\dfrac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}
\end{aligned}
\]

Even though the first formula, Cohen's d, uses SD to represent the
sample standard deviation, and the second, t statistic, uses s, they
represent the same value. So, the only difference is that d has nothing
to do with sample size, but sample size (n) is hugely important in
calculating standard error, which is the denominator for the t
statistic. For Cohen's d, the mean difference is divided by the standard
deviation, which represents the variability in the actual scores within
the sample. For the t statistic, the mean difference is divided by the
standard error, which represents the standard deviation of the
theoretical sampling distribution. By definition, it is going to be much
smaller than the original sample standard deviation.

In this example, the same mean difference (-14.743) served as the
numerator for both d and t. When we divided it by standard error for the
t statistic, we got -1.938. This told us how far our sample mean was
from the center of the sampling distribution. When we divided it by the
sample standard deviation for Cohen's d, we got -0.33, which told us how
far our sample mean was from the population mean, the center of the
population distribution.

If nothing else, we hope this helps you see why we need both effect size
and hypothesis tests. Effect size tells us how big a difference is while
the hypothesis test tells us whether we can be confident the difference
is a result of something other than chance. Effect size does not depend
on sample size, but you are more likely to get a significant result from
your hypothesis test as you increase the sample size.

It is common to report effect size after the results of your hypothesis
test. For example, scores for students in this third-grade class (M =
425.26) were significantly lower than scores of third graders statewide,
t(34) = -1.938, p = 0.03, d = -0.33. You might also choose to report the
significant result followed by a statement that Cohen's d (-0.33)
indicated a medium effect size. Keep in mind that if you have a small
sample size, you might be able to calculate a large effect size even
without a significant result. This can be interesting to learn and might
suggest you should try to conduct your analysis again with a larger
sample size. But we don't report effect size after a non-significant
result since it does not make sense to describe the size of an effect
you just concluded does not exist.

\section{Confidence Intervals}\label{confidence-intervals}

How do confidence intervals fit in? Confidence intervals provide an
additional layer of transparency by offering a range of values likely to
contain the true population parameter.

The way we think about it, the reason we use confidence intervals is to
be up front about our level of uncertainty. We take a sample and report
the mean, but how confident are we that the mean of our sample is equal
to the true population mean? Or we have two samples and we find the
difference between the two means (stay tuned for the next chapter), but
how confident are we that we know the true difference? If we report a
point estimate (e.g., a mean) along with an interval estimate, we are
being completely transparent about how good our estimate is likely to
be.

Another high-level concept to be aware of before we dive into the
details is the balance between precision and accuracy. Say we want to
estimate the average height of all people in the entire world who are 18
and older. We could be highly confident in our accuracy if we estimated
that the mean height of all adults was somewhere between 2 feet
(60.96cm) and 8 feet (243.84cm) . Don't you feel pretty comfortable
accepting that the true population mean is somewhere within that
interval? And yet, do you feel like you have learned any useful
information? Probably not, because our estimate has almost zero
precision. We could go in another direction and estimate that the
average height was exactly 65.8 inches (167.13cm). That estimate is much
more precise, but who knows how accurate it is?

What we often do is report both point and interval estimates. We
commonly see this with survey results. We start with a sample mean and
then use the standard error to calculate a confidence interval. The more
confident we are (higher level of accuracy), the wider the interval
(less precision). We can decide on any confidence level we want and
calculate the exact interval, but it is most common to use 90, 95, or
99\%.

\subsection{Interpreting Confidence
Intervals}\label{interpreting-confidence-intervals}

Now that you have the general idea about the purpose of confidence
intervals, we are going to get a little pedantic and refer you to the
words of
\href{https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1009&context=imseteach}{Dr.~Paul
Savory (2008)}. Say you want to know the mean of some variable in the
population. You take a sample, find the mean, and then create a 95\%
confidence interval around it. It is incorrect to say, ``There is a 95\%
probability that μ falls within this interval.'' This is incorrect
because it implies that μ is random and could take on different values.
In fact, μ is a constant -- we just don't know what it is -- and it
either falls within our interval or it doesn't. The correct
interpretation is, ``We are confident that if μ were known, this
interval would contain it.'' This may seem like a trivial difference,
but it makes an important point that the probability or confidence level
we report is referring to the interval, not the population parameter
itself.

We highly recommend visiting the book's website to test out the
\href{no\%20link\%20right\%20now\%20:/}{confidence intervals applet} for
a helpful visualization of the concept. The way the applet works is that
you select the confidence level and sample size, and then it will
randomly pull one or 25 samples from the population distribution. If you
request 25 samples, you will see them all lined up. Each sample will
have a mean and corresponding confidence interval around it.

We used a 90\% confidence interval with a sample size of 10 in the
following example and asked the applet to take 25 samples, see figure
8.6. Almost all resulting samples had a confidence interval that
contained the true population mean, but two did not. Note that 23/25 is
92\% and not 90\%, but when we try again, sometimes we get 24/25 or
22/25. Even our 90\% confidence interval is just an estimate. The applet
provides a great visualization of the difference between the original
population distribution and the sampling distribution. You recommend
playing around in the applet to see how increasing the confidence level
and/or the sample size will typically result in a greater percentage of
possible sample intervals containing the true population mean.

\subsection{Calculating Confidence
Intervals}\label{calculating-confidence-intervals}

We are going to be calculating confidence intervals around a sample
mean, but keep in mind that you can estimate a confidence interval
around other statistics as well, such as a mean difference or an odds
ratio. Here is how we estimate an unknown population mean using a
confidence interval (CI) when population standard deviation is unknown:

\[
\text{CI for Population Mean}
=
\text{Sample Mean}
\;\pm\;
(\text{Level of Confidence}) \times (\text{Standard Error})
\]

In mathematical terms:

\[
CI(\mu) = \bar{X} \pm t_{\text{critical}} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
\]

So, there are three steps to estimate a confidence interval for a
population mean.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Compute the sample mean and standard error.
\item
  Choose the level of confidence and find the critical values of the t
  distribution for that level.
\item
  Compute the estimation formula to find the upper and lower confidence
  interval limits.
\end{enumerate}

The width of our interval depends on several factors: how confident we
want to be, the size of our sample, and the variability (or standard
deviation) of scores within our sample.

Let's work through an example. Suppose you selected a sample of 100
participants and computed sample statistics. You found a sample mean of
4 and SD of 5. Now, you want to estimate a confidence interval around
that mean.

\subsubsection*{Step 1: Compute the sample mean and standard
error}\label{step-1-compute-the-sample-mean-and-standard-error}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Step 1: Compute the sample mean and
standard error}

From the information above, we already know that X̅ = 4, SD = 5, and n =
100, so we can calculate the standard error as follows:

\[
\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{100}} = 0.5
\]

\subsubsection*{Step 2: Choose the level of confidence and find critical
values}\label{step-2-choose-the-level-of-confidence-and-find-critical-values}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Step 2: Choose the level of
confidence and find critical values}

How do we know what level of confidence to choose? This is where you
must balance precision and accuracy. In social science research we
typically use a 95\% level of confidence, which as you saw is consistent
with our typical practice of choosing an alpha level of 0.05 for
hypothesis testing.

We look to the Critical Values of t Distribution Table in the appendix
to find the critical value. Find the t value for a 95\% level of
significance for a two-tailed test with df = 99. There is no row for 99
degrees of freedom in the table, so we will use df = 100 for an
approximation, and we get the t value of 1.98.

\subsubsection*{Step 3: Compute the estimation formula to find upper and
lower confidence interval
limits.}\label{step-3-compute-the-estimation-formula-to-find-upper-and-lower-confidence-interval-limits.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Step 3: Compute the estimation
formula to find upper and lower confidence interval limits.}

Using these numbers in the formula from earlier in the chapter, we get:

\[
4 \pm 1.98 \times 0.5 = (3.01,\; 4.99)
\]

We can conclude that we are 95\% confident the interval of 3.01 to 4.99
contains the true population mean.

\subsection{Using a Confidence Interval to Evaluate a Null
Hypothesis}\label{using-a-confidence-interval-to-evaluate-a-null-hypothesis}

We are going to walk through one more scenario using our original
one-sample t test example. This example will demonstrate how estimation
through confidence intervals is connected to hypothesis testing, showing
that both methods can provide related insights into evaluating a null
hypothesis.

\subsubsection*{Step 1: Compute the sample mean and standard
error}\label{step-1-compute-the-sample-mean-and-standard-error-1}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Step 1: Compute the sample mean and
standard error}

We already calculated the relevant values, but to get everything back in
one place, our sample mean was X̅ = 425.26, our standard error was 7.605,
and we wanted to know if our sample mean could be considered equal to
the population mean of 440.

\subsubsection*{Step 2: Choose the level of confidence and find critical
values}\label{step-2-choose-the-level-of-confidence-and-find-critical-values-1}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Step 2: Choose the level of

How do we know what level of confidence to choose? This is where you
must balance precision and accuracy. In social science research we
typically use a 95\% level of confidence, which as you saw is consistent
with our typical practice of choosing an alpha level of 0.05 for

\subsubsection*{Step 3: Compute the estimation formula to find upper and

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Step 3: Compute the estimation

\[

\]

We can conclude that we are 95\% confident the interval of 3.01 to 4.99
contains the true population mean.

\subsection{Using a Confidence Interval to Evaluate a Null
Hypothesis}\label{using-a-confidence-interval-to-evaluate-a-null-hypothesis-1}

We are going to walk through one more scenario using our original
one-sample t test example. This example will demonstrate how estimation
through confidence intervals is connected to hypothesis testing, showing
that both methods can provide related insights into evaluating a null
hypothesis.

\subsubsection*{Step 1: Compute the sample mean and standard
error}\label{step-1-compute-the-sample-mean-and-standard-error-2}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Step 1: Compute the sample mean and

and we wanted to know if our sample mean could be considered equal to
the population mean of 440.

\subsubsection*{Step 2: Choose the level of confidence and find critical
values}\label{step-2-choose-the-level-of-confidence-and-find-critical-values-2}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Step 2: Choose the level of
confidence and find critical values}

When we conducted the t test, we decided to use a directional test. This
time for creating a confidence interval, we will use the critical value
associated with a two-tailed test. So, we need to find the t value for a
95\% level of significance for a two-tailed test with df = 34. Our table
doesn't have a row for df = 34, so we will use df = 30 for a
conservative approximation, and we get the t value of 2.042. Note that
the exact critical t value for df = 34 at a 95\% confidence level is t =
2.032.

\subsubsection*{Step 3: Compute the estimation formula to find upper and
lower confidence interval
limits.}\label{step-3-compute-the-estimation-formula-to-find-upper-and-lower-confidence-interval-limits.-1}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Step 3: Compute the estimation
formula to find upper and lower confidence interval limits.}

Using the numbers from earlier in the chapter, we get: \[
425.26 \pm 2.042 \times 7.605 = (409.73,\; 440.79)
\]

If the value of the population parameter we started with (μ = 440) is
contained within our 95\% confidence interval, then we cannot reject the
null hypothesis. As you can see, 440 is just barely contained within our
95\% confidence interval. If we had used a two-tailed test instead of a
one-tailed test earlier, we would have failed to reject the null
hypothesis. This reinforces the importance of identifying one-tailed or
two-tailed tests before running your statistical analysis.

\section{Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit
Test}\label{chi-square-goodness-of-fit-test}

Most of the methods we will learn throughout this book are parametric,
meaning that we are using a sample to test hypotheses about parameters
(e.g., means and variances) in a population. But not all research
questions involve population parameters, so parametric methods don't
always meet our needs. Most of the methods we learn also come with
certain assumptions, but real-world data won't always meet those
assumptions. Nonparametric statistical tests are methods used in
statistics that do not require the data to follow a specific
distribution, such as the normal distribution. These tests are
particularly useful when:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The data violate assumptions required for parametric tests (e.g.,
  normality, homogeneity of variance).
\item
  The data are ordinal or ranked instead of being measured on an
  interval or ratio scale.
\item
  The data contain outliers or are severely skewed.
\end{itemize}

The first nonparametric technique we will learn is the
\textbf{chi-square goodness-of-fit test}. If you have data on a single
variable, and you want to compare it to known or expected values, you
will use the chi-square goodness-of-fit test. This test will allow you
to evaluate how well your observed data align with these expected
values. While the expected values may sometimes represent an even
distribution across groups, it is not a requirement. The key is that you
already know the expected values.

Use this test when your goal is to determine whether a discrepancy
between a set of proportions (frequencies) that you are expecting to see
and a set that you have observed is not simply due to a sampling error
or random chance. Let's look at the goodness-of-fit test more closely
with an example.

Suppose you want to investigate whether a state-level STEM enrichment
program provides equitable access based on gender. Across the state, 474
students were selected to participate in the program. You would expect
237 males and 237 females, assuming a 50/50 split if there were perfect
gender balance in the selection process. However, the actual frequencies
are displayed in the table below.

\textbf{Gender Distribution of Participants}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
Gender & Frequency & Percent \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
Female & 216 & 45.6 \\
Male & 258 & 54.4 \\
\textbf{Total} & \textbf{474} & \textbf{100} \\
\end{longtable}

The distribution is clearly not 50/50, but is it different enough that
the outcome is likely not a result of random chance? To answer this
question, we apply a chi-square goodness-of-fit test. This is another
way to test a hypothesis, so we follow the same steps we have already
learned.

\subsection*{Step 1: State the research question and determine the null
and alternative
hypotheses.}\label{step-1-state-the-research-question-and-determine-the-null-and-alternative-hypotheses.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Step 1: State the research question
and determine the null and alternative hypotheses.}

Typically, we can make two types of predictions for goodness-of-fit
tests. We often expect all categories to be equal. We would expect a
50/50 gender split if participants are limited to only selecting between
female and male. Similarly, we would expect 25\% of students to choose
each menu item if limited to four quality lunch options. But other
times, we have reason to expect distributions to not be evenly split
across options. For example, imagine we wanted to investigate the
proportion of students identified as gifted by race/ethnicity. If we had
participants from five different groups, we would not necessarily expect
20\% of the gifted students to come from each group. Instead, we would
expect that the distribution of gifted students match the percentage of
students from each group in the student body overall.

In this example, our null hypothesis is that there is no difference in
proportions by gender, or mathematically, the proportions of males and
females selected are equal to the expected proportions (i.e., 50\%
each). The alternative hypothesis is that there is a significant
difference by gender, or the proportions of males and females selected
are NOT equal to expected proportions.

\subsection*{Step 2: Set the criteria for a
decision.}\label{step-2-set-the-criteria-for-a-decision.-1}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Step 2: Set the criteria for a
decision.}

We will once again use our typical alpha level of 0.05. If the p value
is smaller than 0.05, we will reject the null hypothesis. The next part
of this step is finding the critical value, and that brings us to a new
distribution: the chi-square distribution. Like the t distribution, the
chi-square distribution is a whole family of distributions that varies
depending on the degrees of freedom. The chi-square distribution is a
probability distribution that arises when a sum of the squares of ￼
independent standard normal random variables is calculated. If
(\textbf{\emph{Equation broken here in original doc need fixing}})
follows a chi-square distribution with ￼ degrees of freedom (df).

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapter8_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{Fig 8.7: Chi-Square Distributions with Different Degrees of
Freedom}

\end{figure}%

For the chi-square goodness-of-fit test, the degrees of freedom are
equal to k -1, where k = the number of categories or levels within your
variable. Our variable is gender, and participants were confined to just
two categories (k = 2), so we have just 1 degree of freedom. Since we
are using α = 0.05, we can flip to the Critical Values of Chi-Square
(\(x^2\)) in the appendix and find that the critical value is 3.84.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{chapter8_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-5-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{Figure 8.8: Chi-square distribution with df = 1}

\end{figure}%

One thing you might notice about this table of critical values is that
unlike most of the tables we have used, the critical value increases as
degrees of freedom increase. The reason for this will make sense when
you see the formula for the test statistic. Another important point is
that the chi-square test is always one-tailed, even though our
alternative hypothesis does not imply any specific direction for the
difference. Instead, we test for the total deviation from the expected
values. We reject the null hypothesis if our observed chi-square
statistic exceeds the critical value.

\subsection*{Step 3: Verify that data meet necessary assumptions for the
statistical method, and calculate the test
statistic.}\label{step-3-verify-that-data-meet-necessary-assumptions-for-the-statistical-method-and-calculate-the-test-statistic.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Step 3: Verify that data meet
necessary assumptions for the statistical method, and calculate the test
statistic.}

There are two data conditions that are required for the use of a
chi-square test:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Observations are independent, meaning the same individual or case
  cannot be categorized into more than one group.
\item
  The expected frequency count (n) for each cell or category should be 5
  or more. If your expected values are too small, that will cause
  problems with the calculation of the test statistic. The most common
  solutions to this problem are increasing your sample size to ensure
  sufficient observations in each cell or merge categories to achieve
  larger expected frequencies. You might also choose to conduct a
  Fisher's exact test, which we will not detail in this book.
\end{enumerate}

When we talk about chi-square tests, we use the word ``cell.'' Think of
this as if you are creating a table with rows and columns. A cell is
just one square in the table. It belongs to one row and one column. In
this example, our table is one column (count of students) by two rows
(female/male). So, we have two cells altogether.

The formula for the goodness-of-fit test is:

\[
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
\]

In this formula, Oi = the observed count of ith cell (i.e., how many
individuals we observed actually fall within the cell) and Ei = the
expected count of ith cell (the number of individuals that we think
should be in the cell). For each cell, we would find a difference
between observed and expected values, square the difference (remember,
if we are adding up differences and want the answer to be something
other than zero, we must square the differences first), and divide it by
the expected value. We would then take these squared values for every
comparison between the expected and observed pair and add them together.

Can you see why it is problematic if expected counts are very small? If
you look at the formula for the chi-square test statistic, the expected
value goes in the denominator. If we have a very low expected value, we
can end up with an artificially inflated test statistic, which increases
the risk of Type I error.

In our example, we already know the expected frequencies (a 50/50 split
of 474 employees would be 237 in each group). We also have the observed
frequencies from the table earlier in the chapter, so we add those
values to the equation:

\[
\chi^2 = \frac{(216 - 237)^2}{237} + \frac{(258 - 237)^2}{237} = 3.72
\]

\subsection*{Step 4: Draw a conclusion for your research
question.}\label{step-4-draw-a-conclusion-for-your-research-question.}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Step 4: Draw a conclusion for your
research question.}

We compare our observed chi-square test statistic to the critical value
we determined earlier. Remember, if our observed value is greater than
the critical value, we reject the null. In this case, 3.72 \textless{}
3.84, so we fail to reject the null. While there is not an exact 50/50
split in employees along gender lines, the difference is not large
enough to be considered significant. The exact p value associated with

\caption{Figure 8.9: Chi-square distribution (df = 1) with critical
value and observed test statistic}

\end{figure}%

Here, we present an example of a chi-square goodness-of-fit result
written in APA style.

A chi-square goodness-of-fit test was conducted to determine whether the
state-level STEM enrichment program provides equitable access based on
gender, with expected proportions for male and female participants. All
assumptions for the analysis were met. The results indicated no
statistically significant difference in the proportions of males and
females selected for the program (\textbf{\emph{Equation broken here}}).
These findings suggest that the enrichment program provides equitable
access by gender.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

Hypothesis testing bridges theoretical research questions and practical
data analysis, offering a structured framework for making evidence-based
decisions. By understanding statistical significance, effect sizes, and
confidence intervals, researchers can draw meaningful conclusions while
accounting for uncertainty and variability. For educational researchers,
it is particularly important to assess both statistical and practical
significance when interpreting empirical results.

While p values indicate whether a result is statistically significant,
they do not reveal the magnitude or practical relevance of the effect.
Measures of effect size, such as Cohen's d, provide valuable context by
quantifying the size of an effect, helping researchers determine its
importance in real-world settings. For example, a small p value paired
with a negligible effect size may lack practical significance, limiting
its applicability. Therefore, when statistically significant findings
are observed, it is essential to consider their implications within the
research context, ensuring that the results are both statistically sound
and practically meaningful. This dual evaluation enhances the relevance
and impact of research findings in education and beyond.

\subsection{Key Takeaways for Educational Researchers from Chapter
8}\label{key-takeaways-for-educational-researchers-from-chapter-8}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Two statistical methods, one-sample t tests and Chi-square
  goodness-of-fit tests, are for comparing the observed statistic to a
  benchmark. Use a one-sample t test when comparing a sample mean to a
  known population mean with unknown standard deviation. Use a
  chi-square goodness-of-fit test when comparing observed proportions or
  frequencies in a single categorical variable to known or expected
  distributions.
\item
  Statistical significance (e.g., p values) indicates whether an
  observed effect is unlikely due to chance, while effect sizes (e.g.,
  Cohen's d) quantify the magnitude and practical relevance of the
  effect. By reporting both, education researchers can ensure their
  findings have actionable value, informing policy, curriculum design,
  or classroom interventions.
\item
  The correct interpretation of a 95\% confidence interval (CI) for a
  population mean is as follows: ``We are 95\% confident that the
  interval contains the true population mean.'' If we were to take many
  random samples of fixed sample size (e.g., n = 50) from the population
  and compute a confidence interval for each sample, approximately 95\%
  of those intervals would contain the true population mean. Confidence
  intervals help researchers communicate the degree of certainty in
  their findings, ensuring that conclusions account for variability and
  are not overly dependent on a single estimate. They are particularly
  beneficial when researchers want to evaluate the reliability of a
  point estimate or compare results across studies.
\item
  Larger sample sizes increase statistical power but may detect trivial
  differences as significant. Carefully designing studies to balance
  power with meaningfulness enables education researchers to use
  resources effectively and avoid misinterpreting results as practically
  relevant when they are not.
\end{itemize}

\section{Key Definitions for Chapter
8}\label{key-definitions-for-chapter-8}

The \textbf{chi-square distribution} is a probability distribution that
arises when a sum of the squares of k independent standard normal random
variables is calculated. If (\textbf{\emph{Equation broken here}})

follows a chi-square distribution with k degrees of freedom (df).

The \textbf{chi-square goodness-of-fit test} is a nonparametric method
used to determine whether observed data frequencies match expected
frequencies for a single categorical variable. This test is useful when
comparing observed proportions to known or hypothesized distributions,
such as evaluating gender equality in a workforce. By calculating the
chi-square statistic and comparing it to a critical value, researchers
can assess whether deviations from expected frequencies are due to
random chance or are statistically significant.

\textbf{Cohen's} \textbf{\emph{d}} quantifies the magnitude of the
difference between two means relative to the variability in the data and
provides a standardized measure of practical significance, helping to
interpret the importance of the result by allowing us to express the
effect size in terms of standard deviation units.

\textbf{Confidence intervals (CIs)} provide an additional layer of
transparency by offering a range of values likely to contain the true
population parameter. The chapter highlighted the interplay between CIs
and hypothesis testing, explaining that if a null value (e.g., a
population mean) falls within the CI, the null hypothesis cannot be
rejected.

\textbf{Effect size} is a numeric measure that indicates the strength or
meaningfulness of the relationship or difference between variables in a
study.

\textbf{Nonparametric statistical tests} are methods used in statistics
that do not require the data to follow a specific distribution, such as
the normal distribution.

\textbf{Type III error} occurs when researchers correctly calculate
statistical results but misinterpret or apply them to the wrong question
or hypothesis.
