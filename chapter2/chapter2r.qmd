# Chapter 2: Central Tendency in R {.unnumbered}

This section demonstrates how to calculate and interpret the mean, median, and mode in R using data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA).

To illustrate the calculations, let’s extract plausible value 1 math achievement (PV1MATH) from the PISA U.S. dataset.
